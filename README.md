Welcome,

Progressive Win is a new casino game concept inveted by me, the creator of this game, by Ross Glacken. 
The user can bet on a range of selections. After each bet, if they didn't yet pick the correct selection, 
the selection choice is reduced and they can bet again, at the same cost - each attempt is technically a bet - and at the same original odds. 
They can repeat this process until they win, run out of funds or choose to quit.

## Notes

This is still a work in progress. I need to consider how to:
- create a wallet for the user
- manage deductions from their wallet balance after each bet is placed
- update their wallet if / when they win

## This game instance

I have set the game to have a selection of 11 numbers.

The user can choose any number and if they are correct they will win 10x their bet amount.

This gives the house an edge of approximately 9%, from which they can profit by running the game.

## Issues
- Late submission
- Catching up on course

## Code check
- passes pep8 validator check with no issues
- heroku app is working correctly
