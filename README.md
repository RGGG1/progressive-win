Welcome,

Progressive Win is a new casino game concept inveted by me, the creator of this game, by Ross Glacken. The user can bet on a range of selections. After each bet, if they didn't yet pick the correct selection, the selection choice is reduce and they can bet again, at the same odds. They can repeat this process until they win, or run out of funds.

## Notes

This is still a work in progress. We need to consider how to:
- create a wallet for the user
- manage deductions from their wallet balance after each bet is placed
- update their wallet if / when they win

## This game instance

I have set the game to have a selection of 11 numbers.

The user can choose any number and if they are correct they will win 10x their bet amount.

This gives the house an edge of approximately 9%, from which they can profit by running the game.

## Issues

- Problems deploying to Heroku
- Late submission
- Catching up on course
